This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the facebooks guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


This library has been created with npm eject which pulls all the dependencies outside.

The purpose of this project is to create a component which receives a json formatted object and prints a table. Based on the structure of data it automatically adds rowspans to the table to make it look formatted. The user needs to do no configuration, just pass the json object and if the data is in a way that the columns in rows can be merged it is automatically done by the project.
